Selected Projects from my Master's Degree Program at Indiana University 2016-2018.

* **Effect of Climate Change on Lake Matinenda Ice-Out Dates.** &nbsp;&nbsp; [Report](https://github.com/annablepj/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Matinenda%20Ice-Out%20Analysis/Climate%20Change%20Effect%20on%20Ice%20Out%20Times.pdf) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   [Code](https://github.com/annablepj/data-science-portfolio/tree/master/Matinenda%20Ice-Out%20Analysis) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/peter.annable#!/vizhome/LakeMatinendaIce-OutAnalysis/Ice-OutStoryBoard) <br>
  A study on the effect of climate change on the ice-out time on the lake of my cottage in Northern Ontario.  I show correlations between ice-out occurring earlier on average to local, regional and global climate trends.<br>
* **Use of Hidden Markov Models to Predict Change in Brand Household Penetration** &nbsp;&nbsp; [Report](https://github.com/annablepj/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/I526%20AML%20-%20Final%20Project%20WriteUp%20-%20Annable.pdf) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   [Code](https://github.com/annablepj/data-science-portfolio/tree/master/Machine%20Learning) <br>
  Applied Machine Learning final project that demonstrates the use of a Hidden Markov Model training algorithm to model change in brand household penetration data based on underlying drivers.  <br>
* **High Performance Tweet Analysis using MPI** &nbsp;&nbsp; [Report](https://github.com/annablepj/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/High%20Perf%20Computing/E517-HighPerformanceTweetAnalysis-Annable.pdf) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   [Code](https://github.com/annablepj/data-science-portfolio/tree/master/High%20Perf%20Computing) <br>
  Analysis of twitter activity is a good proxy for understanding overall sentiment on topical issues, brands or marketing campaigns.  Often such analysis can involve processing of millions of tweets to understand sentiment over longer periods of time.  This paper demonstrates how a Message Passing Interface (MPI) program can be used to allow analysis of a large corpus of tweets over large numbers of processors.  Using twitter data from the Indiana University Observatory on Social Media project to gather large numbers of tweets based on selected hashtags, strong scaling of tweet analysis is shown using up to 256 processing cores.  <br>
