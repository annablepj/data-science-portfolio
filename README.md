Selected Projects from my Master's Degree Program at Indiana University 2016-2018.

* **Effect of Climate Change on Lake Matinenda Ice-Out Dates.** &nbsp;&nbsp; [Report](https://github.com/annablepj/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Matinenda%20Ice-Out%20Analysis/Climate%20Change%20Effect%20on%20Ice%20Out%20Times.pdf) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   [Code](https://github.com/annablepj/data-science-portfolio/tree/master/Matinenda%20Ice-Out%20Analysis) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/peter.annable#!/vizhome/LakeMatinendaIce-OutAnalysis/Ice-OutStoryBoard) <br>
  A study on the effect of climate change on the ice-out time on the lake of my cottage in Northern Ontario.  I show correlations between ice-out occurring earlier on average to local, regional and global climate trends.  Data from 1932 to 2018 is analyzed.<br>
* **Use of Hidden Markov Models to Predict Change in Brand Household Penetration** &nbsp;&nbsp; [Report](https://github.com/annablepj/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/I526%20AML%20-%20Final%20Project%20WriteUp%20-%20Annable.pdf) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   [Code](https://github.com/annablepj/data-science-portfolio/tree/master/Machine%20Learning) <br>
  Applied Machine Learning final project that demonstrates the use of a Hidden Markov Model training algorithm to model change in brand household penetration data based on underlying drivers.  <br>
* **High Performance Tweet Analysis using MPI** &nbsp;&nbsp; [Report](https://github.com/annablepj/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/High%20Perf%20Computing/E517-HighPerformanceTweetAnalysis-Annable.pdf) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   [Code](https://github.com/annablepj/data-science-portfolio/tree/master/High%20Perf%20Computing) <br>
  Analysis of twitter activity is a good proxy for understanding overall sentiment on topical issues, brands or marketing campaigns.  Often such analysis can involve processing of millions of tweets to understand sentiment over longer periods of time.  This paper demonstrates how a Message Passing Interface (MPI) program can be used to allow analysis of a large corpus of tweets over large numbers of processors.  Using twitter data from the Indiana University Observatory on Social Media project to gather large numbers of tweets based on selected hashtags, strong scaling of tweet analysis is shown using up to 256 processing cores.  <br>
* **Agile Analytics â€“ Combining Multiple Datasources using SQL and NOSQL Structures** &nbsp;&nbsp; [Report](https://github.com/annablepj/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/NOSQL/Official%20Final%20Paper-AgileAnalytics_V5.pdf) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  By identifying in three broad aggregations of data: real estate, quality of life and demographic; a detailed agile relational database has been constructed to enable detailed queries in order to answer a specific set of questions related to the identification of prime real-estate markets in an identified metropolitan market. A variety of commercial and public data sources provided the basis of the data warehouse. Data were then processed and made available for query using MySQL as the main relational database warehouse. From there, Tableau software for data visualization generated geographic data visualizations. Further development of the data includes the integration of No SQL database data managed using MongoDB for the development of a web-based Micro-service through and API. <br>
* **Visualization of a Occupational Therapy Research Database.** &nbsp;&nbsp; [Report](https://github.com/annablepj/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Info%20Visualization/Visualization%20of%20Research%20in%20Occupational%20Threapy%20Database-Group1-FinalPaper.pdf) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/peter.annable#!/vizhome/AOTAResearchDatabase/StudyExplorer) <br>
  The American Occupational Therapy Foundation (AOTF), in partnership with the American Occupational Therapy Association, has started to maintain a database of research in the field.  We demonstrate how data visualizations can provide insights for building scientific networks, identifying scientific leaders for specific initiatives, and summarizing capacity to external stakeholder groups.  We find that seven institutions have received 80% of total funding dollars. While research connected to Stroke is the largest overall, research related to Autism Spectrum Disorder has grown from none in early years to being the top diagnosis area. Overall there are 29 different research areas funded between 1982 and 2016 with an approximate funding of $153 million. The three most researched areas are Autism, Stroke, and Sensory integration areas.  Insights are limited to current data available and do not reflect all research in occupational therapy.  We demonstrated the need to expand upon the data collection efforts and use data based techniques for guiding future research.  .<br>
