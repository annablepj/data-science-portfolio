Selected Projects from my Master's Degree Program at Indiana University 2016-2018.

* **Effect of Climate Change on Lake Matinenda Ice-Out Dates.** &nbsp;&nbsp; [Report](https://github.com/annablepj/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Matinenda%20Ice-Out%20Analysis/Climate%20Change%20Effect%20on%20Ice%20Out%20Times.pdf) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   [Code](https://github.com/annablepj/data-science-portfolio/tree/master/Matinenda%20Ice-Out%20Analysis) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/peter.annable#!/vizhome/LakeMatinendaIce-OutAnalysis/Ice-OutStoryBoard) <br>
  A study on the effect of climate change on the ice-out time on the lake of my cottage in Northern Ontario.  I show correlations between ice-out occurring earlier on average to local, regional and global climate trends.  Data from 1932 to 2018 is analyzed.<br>
* **Use of Hidden Markov Models to Predict Change in Brand Household Penetration** &nbsp;&nbsp; [Report](https://github.com/annablepj/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/I526%20AML%20-%20Final%20Project%20WriteUp%20-%20Annable.pdf) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   [Code](https://github.com/annablepj/data-science-portfolio/tree/master/Machine%20Learning) <br>
  Applied Machine Learning final project that demonstrates the use of a Hidden Markov Model training algorithm to model change in brand household penetration data based on underlying drivers.  <br>
* **High Performance Tweet Analysis using MPI** &nbsp;&nbsp; [Report](https://github.com/annablepj/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/High%20Perf%20Computing/E517-HighPerformanceTweetAnalysis-Annable.pdf) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   [Code](https://github.com/annablepj/data-science-portfolio/tree/master/High%20Perf%20Computing) <br>
  High Performance Computing project using Big Red II, a top 500 Super Computer.  Using Message Passing Interface (MPI) programming, a scaled application is built to analyze tweet sentiment over time.  The application demonstrates strong scaling up to 256 cores.<br>
* **Agile Analytics â€“ Combining Multiple Datasources using SQL and NOSQL Structures** &nbsp;&nbsp; [Report](https://github.com/annablepj/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/NOSQL/Official%20Final%20Paper-AgileAnalytics_V5.pdf) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  Use of SQL and NOSQL techniques to combine multiple databases for agile analytics.  MongoDB and Microservices are key technologies used. <br>
* **Visualization of a Occupational Therapy Research Database.** &nbsp;&nbsp; [Report](https://github.com/annablepj/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Info%20Visualization/Visualization%20of%20Research%20in%20Occupational%20Threapy%20Database-Group1-FinalPaper.pdf) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/peter.annable#!/vizhome/AOTAResearchDatabase/StudyExplorer) <br>
  Client project for the American Occupational Therapy Foundation (AOTF).  Visualization techniques are applied to provide insights on occupational research performed over the last 30 years.<br>
* **Data Science Knowledge Base** &nbsp;&nbsp; [Website](http://dskb.soic.indiana.edu/) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  [Code](https://github.com/annablepj/dskb) 
  Independant study project to build a knowledge capture and presentation structure for Indiana University.  A Ruby on Rails website was constructed using Project Blacklight as the core platform.  This project has been applied in subsequent Perspectives in Data Science Classes by the professor. <br>
